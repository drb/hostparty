[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drb/hostparty.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/drb/hostparty) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hostparty.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hostparty)

### Installing:

To use as a CLI tool, you can install hostparty globally.

`npm install -g hostparty`

Or as an API in your own apps to `require()`.

`npm install hostparty --save`

### API:

```javascript
let party = require('hostparty');

// add a couple of hosts mapping to ip 127.0.0.1
party.add('127.0.0.1', ['party-started.com', 'party-pooper.com']);

// see who we have in our hosts file
party.list().then(function(hosts) {

    // `hosts` is an object containing the ip as a key, and the value an array of hostnames
    // 127.0.0.1 party-started.com party-pooper.com
});

// remove the party pooper
party.purge('party-pooper.com');

// remove all entries pointing to ip 127.0.0.1
party.remove('127.0.0.1');

```

### CLI Usage:

From hostparty --help:

```
  Usage: hostparty [options] [command]


  Commands:

    list [options] [hostname]      Outputs the hosts file with optional matching hostname.
    add [options] [ip] [hosts...]  Adds a new host(s) entry for an IP address.
    remove [options] [ips...]      Removes all entries for an IP address.
    purge [options] [hosts...]     Removes all host(s) specified.
    disable [options] [ips...]     Disables (multiple) IP entries.
    enable [options] [ips...]      Enables previously disabled (multiple) IP entries.

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

### Notes:

Some entries such as `::1` on OSX is protected from calls to `remove()` as this is a loopback address used by the operating system during bootup. Purge is supported for hosts bound to the address, but a purge on `localhost` for this IP is protected unless the `--force` flag is used.

More docs coming! ðŸŽ‰
